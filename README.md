Applicants requesting emergency appointments for the purpose of biometric collection must provide proof of emergency (any one of the following) at the time of attending an appointment at the VAC

- Death/Medical Certificate

- Letter from Medical Officer/Unit

- Letter from Funeral Home

Please note the VAC will report all applicants to IRCC who do not present the required proof of emergency at the time of attending an emergency appointment at the VAC. IRCC may take this into consideration when reviewing the application.

An emergency biometric appointment does not affect IRCCâ€™s processing times for the application or the outcome.

Please note that emergency biometric appointments cannot be scheduled using the online appointment system. To schedule an emergency biometric appointment, please do so by calling the VAC Contact Centre or by visiting the VAC in person.
